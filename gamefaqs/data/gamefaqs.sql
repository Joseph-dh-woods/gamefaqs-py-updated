With the resolution of this incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence. However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had defected to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S. government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his native land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it will mark the beginning of a new age of fear. August 1964.

Just three months after the events of Inazuma Eleven GO, Arion Sherwind returns to Raimon Jr. High to discover a baseball field where the football pitch once was. Worse still, there is no sign of the club, while students quietly enjoy other activities, like gymnastics, music and calligraphy its as if football never existed! With the arrival of some mysterious time travellers from 200 years in the future, it becomes clear that Arion is the only one who can save the beautiful game! And thats where things kick off, as you travel through time to explore a huge game world, uncover secret plots, battle rival teams to prove your prowess, and restore football to glory! First things first, though: youll need to choose between two jam-packed editions: Wildfire and Thunderflash. The main story is the same in each, but there are unique scenarios, characters, equipment and more that youll only find in each version. Which will you pick? Once youve chosen, your next task is to form the best team you can. As you play five-a-side Battles against rival squads, youll sometimes get requests to join your team from members of the losing side. Or you could hunt down PalPack Cards from dealers, which show player stats, and anything else required to recruit each of them. With over a thousand potential teammates, you wont be short on choice but youll only be able to recruit a limited number, and there are just 16 slots in your team. Choose wisely! Its all about winning football games though, and there are two flavours: Battle and Match. Battles are small, five-a-side challenges that last just a minute, which you win by completing a certain task, like scoring first. Matches are longer affairs, with 11 players on each side, substitutes, a full-size pitch, and ten minutes of action. In either type, use the stylus to move your player up the pitch, marking, passing and dribbling with a tap. When you meet another player, choose which direction to go and you might even dodge them! Tasty footwork will get you so far, but Special Moves are the real spice of the Inazuma series and this new season is no exception! Each member of your team can have up to six over-the-top, anime-style moves that could turn the tide of a match plus, Fighting Spirits return to supercharge your stats, offering even more powerful Special Moves. On top of that, the new Miximax feature is introduced, which lets you blend player Auras to enhance their abilities. And this time around, armourfied Fighting Spirits can be worn for even more powerful abilities and Special Moves! Between games, youll be chasing the ghosts of former friends through time and space, to get the Raimon Jr. High School football team back together. You wont be alone, though, as the secretive Fei Rune turns up to help you fight the future. On your travels youll unravel the story by chatting to the locals, train hard to strengthen your players abilities, and hunt down lost Auras to reignite the team! As well as the main story, theres lots more to enjoy: take on up to three mates in Local Play, including two-on-two matches, and trade players discovered in Story Mode. Go online to download new items and characters via SpotPass, and activate StreetPass to receive team data from other users, then play matches against their teams.

But after a weird kid appears on the pitch, Arion works out the club is going to be closed down by a shady company called Fifth Sector, the big bosses in charge of youth football. Time to lace up! Before you even think about going near a ball, youve got to make a choice between two editions, Light and Shadow. The core content is the same, but there are unique characters, techniques and teams (among other things) to each. Which one will you choose? After you join the school football club, youll need to recruit a team - and a good one wont be enough. There are two ways to shape your squad: first, you could thrash another team in a five-a-side Battle, and get a request to join from an opposition player. You could also buy some PalPack Cards from dealers. Think of them as brochures for new players, complete with stats and sign-up requirements. As you play more and more, you can potentially meet over a thousand players, but you only get 16 slots for your team, and just 110 for the entire roster, so pick carefully! When the time comes to kick off, youll find two match types. The first one is an 11-man game that lasts ten minutes, while the other is a surprise, five-a-side bash that gives you a single minute to achieve a specific job, like scoring a goal. You play by using the stylus to move your player up the pitch, then tap to kick, pass or mark opponents. When you tackle, everything pauses so you can size up your opponent, then use various statistics to plan your play - dodge or tackle. Special Moves are back, as well. These give each of your players up to six, super-powered, anime-style tricks, which you get during the story or whenever certain players level up. Even better are the brand new Fighting Spirits, which increase players statistics and allow for ever more powerful Special Moves to help you get the edge over the opposing team. When youre not on the pitch, you can explore the local area, check things out, and talk to people to get the lowdown on school life. Later on, youll be able to go to visit Inazuma town and stop off at places like the Shopping Area or the Royal Academy. It all looks gorgeous in full 3D, too! Saving the Raimon Jr. High from Fifth Sector is only part of the package, as theres a stack of other challenges to tackle.

After you join the school football club, youll need to recruit a team - and a good one wont be enough.

You could also buy some PalPack Cards from dealers. Think of them as brochures for new players, complete with stats and sign-up requirements.

The first one is an 11-man game that lasts ten minutes, while the other is a surprise, five-a-side bash that gives you a single minute to achieve a specific job, like scoring a goal. You play by using the stylus to move your player up the pitch, then tap to kick, pass or mark opponents. When you tackle, everything pauses so you can size up your opponent, then use various statistics to plan your play - dodge or tackle. Special Moves are back, as well. These give each of your players up to six, super-powered, anime-style tricks, which you get during the story or whenever certain players level up. Even better are the brand new Fighting Spirits, which increase players statistics and allow for ever more powerful Special Moves to help you get the edge over the opposing team. When youre not on the pitch, you can explore the local area, check things out, and talk to people to get the lowdown on school life. Later on, youll be able to go to visit Inazuma town and stop off at places like the Shopping Area or the Royal Academy. It all looks gorgeous in full 3D, too!

Test your skills against up to three friends in Local Play, including two-on-two matches, or trade players during Story Mode.

For example, an enemy might be clad in formidable armor to begin with, but if that armor is destroyed, the enemys appearance changes and defense ability drops but on the other hand, the enemys movements might become swifter. Dont ignore these changes- use them to alter the battle situation to your advantage! Customize Weapons and Statuses! The characters weapons are each made up of parts, and by combining these parts, you can change attack strength, not to mention the magic and skills the characters can use. Whats more, by reinforcing weapons at a Weapon Shop, you can upgrade the weapons to be much more powerful than they originally were. In addition, by assigning Merit Points on the Status screen, you can strengthen different statuses as you want- and you can adjust these statuses at any time.','Android','Android','Jan 10, 2013',NULL,'http://www.gamefaqs.com/android/697354-rpg-symphony-of-the-origin');

INSERT INTO "INFO" VALUES(1287,'Shadowrun Returns','Jordan Weisman, the creator of Shadowrun, is back and Shadowrun Returns (for Apple & Android tablets and PCs) is the game that Shadowrun fans have been waiting for a long time. A graphically rich 2D turn-based single player game with deep story interaction, meaningful character development, and highly-contextual tactical combat, Shadowrun Returns is not only going to make some old geeks (like us) very happy but it will introduce new players to a dynamic gaming universe that is beloved around the world. Created almost 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game worlds origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of a Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of a Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations. Heres how it works: According to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world will end on December 21, 2012. Its part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them. As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of "goblinization", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED. Fast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technologya continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrixa network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporationsmonolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens. And moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves wont soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to.
